\begin{abstract}
In this paper we propose a novel approach for visual question answering using commonsense knowledge and reasoning and apply it to images of roads taken for autonomous vehicles. Computer vision research is heavily reliant on machine learning techniques in a variety of areas, including visual question answering. We assert that logic programming can be applied to the output of a dense image captioning model to handle question answering. Commonsense reasoning allows us to create an explainable AI that comprehends and reasons over visual data in a manner similar to how a human would. This permits the answering of more complex and difficult questions that machine learning models fail to answer. Using logic programming comes at the added benefit of being readable and alterable, removing the need to train and test a new machine learning model when adjustments to the output must be made.

We apply these concepts to a set of four images of streets to demonstrate how commonsense reasoning can be used to answer questions about autonomous vehicles. The program we made is able to determine if it safe for the driver to move forward, brake, change to the right lane, or change to the left lane given an image of the road in front of the driver. It does this by turning the visual data from the dense captioning model into logic predicates that allow it to determine if there are obstructions that prevent any of the given actions from occurring.
